/* QUESTIONS:
  is an agent’s relationship to another agent from the perspective of the "active" agent? the connected agent? the relationship? me, the observer?
  is a student’s relationship to a school from the perspective of the student? The school? External?:
    A) the activity while they were there "studied at", "learned at", "attended"
    B) the event "graduated from", "produced"
    C) the current/final relationship: "alma mater", "professor/dean/chair"
    D) the roles "student", "professor", "graduate", "alumni"
  are relationships:
    directional? school -> enrolled/alumni/faculty/labs -> person list or person -> attended/graduated/taught/researched -> school list
    temporal? school -> date enrolled/graduated
    spatial? school proximity to others -> city -> country ->
      the value of spatial relationship is high for memory but low for utility
    from the perspective of the entity? person -> professor, person -> almamater, person -> idea?
    from the perspective of the relationship/action? professor/taught -> student/learned
  
  are styles/sizes/placements
    from the perspective of my knowledge?
    from some objective perspective where size/style/spatial is related to importance?
      if I have not ready the major works, but have read some minor work 100x, it should be large and/or close while others are small and/or distant
      perhaps the actual (my) and perceived potential (cultural as I understand it) could be represented. dark/thick for "my", light/thin for "potential"
